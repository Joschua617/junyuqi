## 👋 Biography

I am a researcher specializing in data-driven health management of complex mechanical systems. My work focuses on integrating signal processing, physics-informed neural networks (PINN), and deep learning for robust fault diagnosis and remaining useful life (RUL) prediction under non-stationary operating conditions. I hold a Ph.D. in Mechanical Engineering from KU Leuven and have professional experience at Bosch Rexroth and Reutlingen University.

## 🔬 Research Interests

*   Physics-Informed Machine Learning (PIML)
*   Prognostics and Health Management (PHM)
*   Graph Neural Networks for System-Level Modeling
*   Transfer Learning and Domain Adaptation
*   Edge AI and TinyML for Industrial Applications
